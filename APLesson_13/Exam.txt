Q_01: What is the relationship between class Rumba and class Mambo?
	A: E. There is no class relationship between Rumba and Mambo.
	Mambo doesn't extend Rumba or anything, and there's no relationship between them.

Q_02: Which of the following can be used to replace the /* missing code */ in constructor Mambo so that the desired output is achieved?
	A: C. III only
	Use super() to run the Rumba constructor, then run the Mambo-specific code.
	
Q_03: An Equestrian object is a CircusPerformer who rides ponies over the obstacles. Which of the following methods must be defined in the Equestrian class?
	A: A. I only
	You only need to define the constructor for the Equestrian class. The rest of the methods it inherits from the CircusPerformer class.
	
Q_04: Which of the following implementations can be used to replace /* missing code */. In constructor Equestrian so that the CircusPerformer instance variables are properly initialized?
	A: B. II only
	Option I doesn't work because performername and actName are private instance variables, and it's kinda dumb. Option III uses variables that haven't been defined, so that's not good either.
	
Q_05: What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
	A: D. Compile error message indicating that there is a progblem [sic] with the constructor.
	No constructor for TightRopeWalker, which is the one that gets called. No good. :(
	
Q_06: What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
	A: A. Starts from tight rope platform Walks and flips on the tight rope Exits from tight rope platform
	The new methods in the TightRopeWalker class override the original entrance, performance, and exit methods.
	
Q_07: What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
	A: A. Starts from tight rope platform Walks and flips on the tight rope Exits from tight rope platform
	Inherits the methods from the TightRopeWalker class, which overrode the CircusPerformer class.
	
Q_08: What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
	A: C: Starts from tight rope platform Juggles wile walking and flipping a tight rope Exits from tight rope platform
	Only the performance method is overriden, the other ones are inherited from the TightRopeWalker class.
